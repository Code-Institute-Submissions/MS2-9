# <p align="center">Memory Card Game For All</p>

A memory card game featuring star war characters in lego form which I found amusing, fun and cute. The game is for users of all ages who 
would like to improve their memory whilst also enjoy looking at the images too.
The website consists of the main page with beautiful quality photos, pleasing to the eye, inspiring to look at and simple, not too 
much text, as for myself I don’t like busy looking websites, I like simplicity and beauty. As too much information gets confusing, messy 
and overwhelming.

Reasons users may be want to play this game:
- To improve their memory. 
- To pass the time. 
- Like the humorous quality images. 

# UX

A simple and clean looking website that introduces the user to a single player memory card game consisting of one page:
- A black and white, clean, simple look, with succinct instructions and once you start playing the game the colours of the
images comes through. 
- When the player has finished/won the game, a popup modal matching the colours of the images appears
giving the user the time it took for them to finish and how many moves they made and the choice to play again.
- At the bottom of the card images is a simple  and clean row of a moves counter, minutes and seconds timer and the restart
button.

## User journey:
1. The user begins at the Home page, reading the simple instructions of 'Click the cards to find the matching pairs' under the 
main heading 'Use Your Brain!'.
    
<p align="center"><img width="250" height="300" src="readme-images/ss-index01.jpg"></p>

2. The user then sees the grid of 16 cards in a 4 by 4 grid, all displaying a photo image of the words "USE YOUR BRAIN",
these are the cards to be clicked.

<p align="center"><img width="250" height="300" src=""></p>

3. Scrolling down the page further and user sees the scoreboard underneath the images which consists of three features:
Firstly, a counter to keep track how many clicks the user makes, secondly, a timer displaying in minutes and seconds how long it takes
for the user to find all the matching pairs to finish the game and finally a restart button where they can choose to start again if 
they get distracted during the game, get frustrated, or leave the game for any other reason to start again.
<p align="center"><img width="250" height="300" src=""></p>

4. As soon as the first card is clicked the moves counter and timer begin until all the matching pairs are found or the restart button is clicked.

## User stories:

- As a user, I want a simple and clean looking website as messy, busy pages with lots of information overwhelms me.

- As a user, I want an easy to navigate website to save time and not get frustrated or lost.

- As a user, I want to be able to use it on desktop, tablet and mobile devices.

## Wireframes
I used [Pencil](https://pencil.evolus.vn/) to create
[wireframes](https://github.com/karzuin/MS2/tree/master/wireframes) in desktop, tablet and phone view.

# Features

All three pages consists of a fixed navigation menu bar on top where you can click to go to any of the three pages wherever you are on 
the current page. The three pages also consist of the same footer with four social links taking them to a new tab with the relevant social 
media homepage as there are no Greener Homes social media accounts. Underneath is the copyright information.

I chose a simple clean font called 'Open Sans' to stay consistent with the overall look of being simple and clean. 

The font colours of grey: `rgb(69, 71, 69)` form background colours in grey `bg-secondary`, button colours in green `bg-success` and 
social links in green: `rgb(31, 160, 31)` to link the Greener Homes to the colour green.

## [Index.html](https://karzuin.github.io/First-milestone-project/index.html)

This page has a hero image of a beautiful landscape reminding the user of the beauty of the natural environment, inspiring the user to 
feel calm and to protect the environment. The name of the website ‘Greener Homes’ is displayed, underneath is a concise introduction in the ‘About Us’ section of what 
the website intends to do.

Next heading is ‘Why live in an eco home’ explaining the benefits of living in such a home and among the many variations of eco homes, 
this website chooses the three most popular: Earthships, Tiny Houses and Shipping Container Homes. These sections are in a simple and organised 
format which is easy to read and not overwhelming to the user.

Then the three examples of the eco homes, set in card decks with a beautiful image of each type of home, the name of the type of home and 
a brief concise summary of its benefits and features. A button at the bottom indicating more information when user hovers over it the button colour
goes darker green. When clicked it opens a new tab of the external website providing more information and there is a blue border around the
button to indicate that it has been clicked.

The next section is called ‘Related Interests’ which includes ‘Off Grid Living’, 'Zero Waste Living’ and 'Eco Home Products’ another card 
deck of three as above to keep the style consistent. Each card has a beautiful and informative image of what the subject is about and a 
concise description of its benefits and features. A button at the bottom of the card when user hovers over it the button colour goes darker
green. When clicked it opens into a new tab of the external link providing more information and there is a blue border around the
button to indicate that it has been clicked.

Then there is the ‘Sign Up’ form inviting the user to enter their email address to sign up for Greener Homes latest news. Reassuring the user 
that their email address will not be shared with others. A ‘Sign Up!’ Button for the user to click once the email address is entered. 
If the user clicks the button without entering a valid email address it gives a message to fill in the appropriate field. When user hovers 
over the button it goes a darker green in colour.

At the bottom of the page is a neat row of social links consisting of Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Youtube and underneath is
the copyright information.

### Code

The code for my footer social links were copied from Code Institute source code for the resume project in the user centric frontend 
development module.

[CI](https://codeinstitute.net/) tutor helped me clarify what code to use for column sizes and directed me to [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_background-image.asp)
 to help with background image responsiveness. So I was able to make all the hero images on all three pages responsive.

Used code from [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/books/fundamental-css-tactics/scale-typography-screen-size/) to help with font-size responsiveness.

Mentor shared a link from [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34284976/blank-space-right-side-screen-on-small-device-or-window/34285689#34285689?newreg=609753b69d114fe8855ce8929c156ee3) 
to help rectify the white space on the right of the screen when in mobile phone view.
