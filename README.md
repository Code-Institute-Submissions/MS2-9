A memory card game featuring images of Star Wars characters in lego form which I found amusing, fun and cute. The game is for users of all ages who 
would like to improve their memory whilst also enjoy looking at the images too.
The website consists of the main page with beautiful quality photos, pleasing to the eye, inspiring to look at and simple, not too 
much text, as for myself I don’t like busy looking websites, I like simplicity and beauty. As too much information gets confusing, messy 
and overwhelming.

Reasons users may be want to play this game:
- To improve their memory. 
- To pass the time. 
- Like the humorous quality images. 

# UX

A simple and clean looking website that introduces the user to a single player memory card game consisting of one page:
- A clean, simple look, with succinct instructions.
- The cards are quite large in order to enjoy the images better.
- When the player has finished/won the game, a popup modal matching the colours of the images appears
giving the user the time it took for them to finish and how many moves they made and the choice to play again.
- At the bottom of the card images is a simple  and clean row of a moves counter, minutes and seconds timer and the restart
button.

## User journey:
1. The user begins at the Home page, reading the simple instructions of 'Click the cards to find the matching pairs' under the 
main heading 'Use Your Brain!'.
    
<p align="center"><img width="200" height="100" src="readme-images/homepage01.jpg"></p>

2. The user then sees the grid of 16 cards in a 4 by 4 grid, all displaying a photo image of the words "USE YOUR BRAIN",
these are the cards to be clicked.

3. Scrolling down the page further and user sees the scoreboard underneath the images which consists of three features:
Firstly, a counter to keep track how many clicks the user makes, secondly, a timer displaying in minutes and seconds how long it takes
for the user to find all the matching pairs to finish the game and finally a restart button where they can choose to start again if 
they get distracted during the game, get frustrated, or leave the game for any other reason to start again.

<p align="center"><img width="200" height="100" src="readme-images/homepage02.jpg"></p>

4. As soon as the first card is clicked the moves counter and timer begin until all the matching pairs are found or the restart button is clicked.

## User stories:

- As a user, I want a simple and clean looking website as messy, busy pages with lots of information overwhelms me.

- As a user, I want an easy to navigate website to save time and not get frustrated or lost.

- As a user, I want to be able to use it on desktop, tablet and mobile devices.

- As a user, I want to have a fun time playing the game.

- As a user, I want to see interesting and fun images some easy to memorise and some not so easy.

- As a user, I want simple instructions.

The user’s goals can be met via this website as it is a simple game with fun and interesting images.

It is easy to navigate with one page, simple, clear and succinct instructions and self explanatory restart button.

# Features

The homepage consists of the main heading and the simple, clear instructions of how to play in a smaller heading underneath.
The card game appears under the heading in a 4 x 4 grid displaying 16 images of a photo with the text saying 'Use Your Brain'
which inspired me to name the game the same name.
The card sizes are larger than most card games seen online, as I wanted the images to be seen and appreciated.
The scoreboard is underneath the grid featuring three tools: 
- A counter that keeps track of how many moves/ clicks a player makes.
- A timer that keeps track of how long it takes for the player to finish the game.
- A restart button, which allows the player to restart the game whenever they want by reloading the page.
Underneath is the copyright information.

I chose a simple clean font that matched the image I found with the text Use Your Brain! called 'Quicksand' to stay consistent with the overall look. 

The font colours are black, pink and blue which matches the colours of the images. The background colour is white.
